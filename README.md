dotfiles for linux config

##Installation
If you already have `python-pip` and the `requests` module installed, you can just run `installDotFiles.py`.

But if you are running an Ubuntu/Debian system, and don't have these yet, you can run `install.sh` which should take care of installing the new packages for you, and then invoke the dotfile installation script. you may be prompted for your password.
